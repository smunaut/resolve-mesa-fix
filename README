Inject `GL_ARB_texture_border_clamp` in the extension list.

Davinci Resolve wants that extension but unfortunately mesa before
23.3 doesn't publish that extension for Core profiles. It is supported
but because in Core profiles this is not optional, it wasn't in the
extension list.

This intercepts some GL calls to forcibly inject it.


To build:

```
make
```


To run:

```
LD_PRELOAD=./resolve_mesa_fix.so /path/to/resolve/bin/resolve
